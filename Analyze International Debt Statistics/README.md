# Analyze International Debt Statistics

This project focuses on the analysis of international debt statistics, specifically for developing countries. It seeks to answer several key questions related to international debt, including:

- What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what is the magnitude of that debt?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing international debt statistics, which includes information on the debt amounts and indicators for multiple countries. This dataset is sourced from international_debt database, and it provides the foundation for our analysis. You can create this db using files in datasets directory.

## Analysis

We have conducted an in-depth analysis of the international debt statistics dataset by using SQL queries. In total, we created 9 different SQL queries to answer the questions posed above and to gain insights into the international debt landscape.
